You can use this scraper to search the blog of Zach Beauvais for posts containing the word _pedantry_.

The good part about this, aside from finding Zach's pedantic ramblings, is that if you change the variables:

* term
* site

to new search word, and the site to another wordpress blog, you'll get the results of those instead.
